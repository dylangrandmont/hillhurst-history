            <h3>Samuel Odber Foster</h3>
            <p>
                Samuel Foster (1869 - 1950) was born in Coldstream, New Brunswick and came west in 1905 with his Wife, Maria Rideout, and Children.
                He worked as a teamster and then an independent builder. 
                He helped construct several homes during Calgary's first housing boom prior to WW1 and was involved in the local Hillhurst Baptist Church.
            </p>
            <p>
                His name is attached to multiple building permits, some of which were published in newspapers as part of larger notices of building activity.
                He obtained permits for at least two homes in 1912, including his own residence at 844 Fourth Avenue NW in March, followed by a $1500 residence on Lot 29, Block 5 in Upper Hillhurst in October.
            </p>
            <h3>John Wilbur Stickney</h3>
            <p>
                John Stickney was employed as a carpenter and co-owned the home with Foster from its construction to 1925.
                Foster is listed under the building permit but most likely the house was constructed by both families.
                Although Stickney migrated to Calgary at a later date (1912), he was from the same county in New Brunswick as Foster.
