        <h1>A School By Any Other Name</h1>
        <h4>What was the name of a Quebecois Laywer Doing on a Calgary School Anyways?</h4>
        <h5>June 1, 2021</h5>
        <p>
            The recent discovery of an unmarked grave at a residential school in Kamloops re-ignited discussions (<a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/nenshi-calgary-residential-schools-rename-1.6048523">and now action</a>) about the naming of Langevin School in the Bridgeland-Riverside neighborhood of Calgary.
            If you're familiar with the story, then you're familiar with the name Langevin and its connection to the residential school system in Canada.
            You might remember the 2018 <a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/4233952/calgarys-reconciliation-bridge-renamed-we-cant-change-the-past-but-we-are-not-prisoners-of-it/">renaming of a bridge by the same name, and for the same reason</a>.
            Maybe these stories make you curious as to who this man <a href="https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/sir-hector-louis-langevin">Hector Langevin</a> was.
            Once your curiosity gets the better of you and you look this fellow up, you're going to have the same question I did:
        </p>
        <p>
            <i>Why on Earth was anything in Calgary named after this guy in the first place?</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            And I don't mean this in the historical-revisionist sense of "how could anyone have honored this person given what they were responsible for?"
            What I mean is "how did this specific school on the Prairies come to be named after an ardent French nationalist?"
        </p>
        <p>
            The deepest I've seen this explained in news articles is that both the school and the bridge are named "in honor of a father of confederation".
            True, in addition to being an architect of the residential school system and its horrendous consequences, Sir Hector Langevin was one of the "fathers of confederation", a group of men who formed the first European self-ruling government within the Dominion of Canada.
            But there were many other such "fathers".
            What was special about Hector Langevin?
            Why <i>Langevin School</i> and not <i>Macdonald School</i>, after the "father" responsible for punching a rail system through the country, a system critical for the existence of Calgary as a permament settlement.
            The answer, it seems, is pretty innocent, even if the man himself was not 
        </p>
        <p> 
            It's difficult to find a definite source, however both the Calgary Board of Education and a 1938 article appear to agree that Langevin School was so named in honor of the man, but primarily for the simple reason that the school was in the immediate vicinity of the Langevin bridge (the same bridge mentioned above)<sup>1</sup>.
            But this just moves the question down the timeline.
            Why was the <i>bridge</i> named after Langevin?
            It turns out the answer to that question, is another question: "<i>Which</i> Langevin bridge?"
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The current steel structure crossing the Bow, which bore his name but is now known as Reconciliation Bridge, dates to 1910.
            Langevin himself died in 1906 so perhaps the newly constructed bridge was to honor his legacy?
            A legacy which would naturally involve his responsibility for the residential school system.
            But Langevin was an ardent supporter for Quebec inside the confederation and this was 1910; it didn't take four years to build a bridge back then.
            Was his impact on this dusty Prairie town really so strong that a modern steel bridge would bear his name, half a decade after his death?
            The answer is "probably not".
            the simpler explanation is that this is not the only Langevin bridge, and it's not the first either.
            In fact, the other Langevin bridge was a wooden structure which stood on nearly the same spot a full century ago.
        </p>
        <p>
            So yet again our question moves further back in time...
            Why was <i>that</i> bridge named after Langevin?
        </p>
        <p>
            The original Langevin bridge was a timber crossing which had been constructed in the 1880s, only a decade or so after Calgary was established as a settlement<sup>2</sup>.
            It had been "completed at a very considerable cost" with funding from the federal government<sup>3,4</sup>.
            Over the years it went through various stages of repair and disrepair<sup></sup> until it was eventually replaced with the steel bridge.
            Just like its successor, it crossed the Bow river at what became 4th street East<sup></sup>.
        </p>
        <p>
            As to the name, we only need to follow the money.
            The source of that federal money is documented in a contemporary article from the <i>Herald</i> and confirmed in later editions<sup></sup>:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <b>Sir Hector's Visit</b><br><br>
            Father LaCombe and Col. Herchimer are in receipt of telegrams from Sir Hector Langevin, in which he places the time of his visit to Calgary about September 5th.
            The citizens intend [to entertain] Sir Hector in a manner that will be appreciated by him. ...
            A number of local improvements (badly needed) will be brought to his notice, a bridge across the Bow, Court house and Jail and a Protestant Cemetery are among the number."<br><br>
            - Calgary Herald, August 27, 1884 (page 1)
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            And so the answer to our question, it appears to me, is that Langevin School was named so because of a bridge which was in turn named for an older bridge which was ultimately named for the man who brought some federal pork dollars to town.
            Recognition for money.
            A nice tip-of-the-hat or a craven money-for-ego exchange?
            You can decide that for yourself.
            For now we can celebrate the removal of this man and his legacy from our public buildings.
            We can mourn the tragedy he helped form in our past.
            And maybe we can better understand why things were so, just in time to make them not.
