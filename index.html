            <h3>The House That Foster Built</h3>

            <p>
                The Coronavirus Pandemic of 2020-2021 forced hundreds of millions of people into their homes for
                extended times.
                Work. Sleep. Play. All within the confines of a single residence.
                I was one of those millions and I happened to be stuck inside a new home.
                Well, new to me; the house itself was almost hundred and ten years old.

            </p>
            <p>
                A Century Home, sure, but not something anyone could reasonably consider "of historical significance".
                No one of great significance ever lived here, its construction is plain and modifications over time have
                largely erased its original layout and finishings.
                It's not going into a historical register, let's put it that way.
            </p>
            <p>
                Still... all this time in a building forms a connection and a home at this age needs some love and some
                of that love took me into the "bones" of the house.
                While adding insulation to the attic, I see the sawn lumber someone dragged from the saw mill to frame
                the home.
                While tearing out a damanged kitchen backsplash, I expose the original mason chimney which would have
                heated the home.
                While building a partition wall, I see the white oak planks which originally covered the floor.
                Leftover remants of knob-n-tube style wiring and cast iron pipes, they all appear, and all this time and
                all these vestiges make a person wonder: what <i>is</i> the history here?
                Who constructed this home which still stands five generations later?
                How many lives ran their course between these walls?
            </p>
            <p>
                As I dug into this research I had no choice but to investigate the history of the larger city and
                society of the time.
                This is where I found the true value in my exercise: the history of this thoroughly average home
                <i>is</i> the history of the city it was built in, of the society which let to its construction.
                Ranchers, the Prairie <i>Nouveaux Riches</i>, Oilmen, Land Speculators, Businessman, Booms, Busts and
                Rejuvination, the Working Class.
                The timeline of the city is embedded in the story of this home, precisely because of its plainness.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is a history of Calgary, as told through My Home.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="text-box">
            <h3>Foreword</h3>
            <p>
                The story of my home is reconstructed here following the timeline of the land and the house built upon it.
                The primary sources used to recreate this history include land title searches, buiding permit records, the archives of the Calgary Herald, and directories for the city of Calgary.
            </p>
            <p>
                For context, it may help to understand legal terms for land division in this area.
                Land within Western Canada is surveyed and divided into <i>sections</i>, which are square mile plots of land.
                These sections are further divided into quarters, following quadrants (NW, NE, SW, SE).
                Development sites are surveyed according to blocks, which are what we usually think of as "city blocks".
                These blocks and then divided into lots.
                Sections, blocks, and lots are all numbered in order.
                The home in this story is therefore located in section 20, block 5, lot 29.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lastly, I want to acknowledge that this is a history reconstructed from legal records.
                As such, the history is biased by the biases of the society which created these records.
                I will not address thousands of years of history in this land by Aboriginal peoples, but I do acknowledge this story takes place on Treaty 7 land.
                Women are more difficult to trace in his history, due to the male dominance of Alberta society in the early 1900s;
                more tragically, their names are often deleted removed from history entirely;
                they are often refered to solely by their husband's name.

                <p>
                    The land at the confluence of the Bow and Elbow rivers was not settled by Europeans until 1875.
                    The land north of the Bow river was not in private hands until later, however.
                    Private ownership of the land now covering lot 29 begins with a land title issued in 1891, to one Samuel Trott.
                    Trott established the first Pharmacy in Calgary, and this titled was issued during the last year of his life.
                    The title was issued to half a section of land in present dat Hillhurst, which was undeveloped ranching land at the time.
                    It is unknown why Trott came into possession of this land in the last year of his life;
                    however, land titles record that half of this land was immediately transfered to the two Alexander brothers, one a Lawyer and the other a Rancher.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Near the turn of the century most the land in present-day Hillhurst came into possession of the Riley family, headed by the rancher Thomas Riley.
                    A land title dated 1902 listed the wife, Georgiana Jane, as the land owner.
                    It is unknown why this land was listed under her name while her husband was still alive at the time.
                    Upon her death in 1907 the family sons inherited, subdivided, and arranged for the annexation of the land by the city.

                <h3>The Boom</h3>
                <p>
                    The Canadian Prairies experienced a massive economic boom in the years leading up to the first World
                    War.
                    Irrigation of farmland, a swelling population of European and Eastern Canadian migrants, and investment from railways
                    all contributed to  multiplying the population of the Prairies, and of Calgary, many times over in a few short
                    years.
                    With a growing population, the city expanded its land base into its first suburbs across the Bow
                    River.
                    The installation of street car lines allowed the growing population to live further from the city's
                    center and high rents incentized the building of new homes in the new suburban communities.
                    A housing shortage pushed land values increasingly higher and land speculation was rife.
                    Real estate became so central to this boom that at its peak in 1912, around 2% of the entire population was employed as realtors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The transaction history on the home tells the story of real estate speculation.
                    In the space of two years the land title for lot 29 exchanged hands no less than five times.
                    During the space of a year the value of the lot doubled from $350 to $750.
                    The speculators held a range of occupations including builders, retailers, and a future oilman.

                <h3>Friends from Out East</h3>
                <p>
                    At the peak of the boom in 1912, every issue of the <i>Calgary Herald</i> carried at least one full page listing real estate investment opportunities.
                    The pages were adorned with the banner "Mail this to some Friend in the East".
                    It appears that Samuel Foster, a builder who had emmigrated west from Carleton County, New Brunswick in 1905, may have done exactly that.
                    In that year Foster is listed as the co-owner on a land title to lot 29, alongside John W Stickney, who had arrived in the same year from the same New Brunswick county.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the fall of 1912, Foster received a building permit to construct a wooden framed residence on lot 29.
                    His name is found to several other building permits in the neighbourhood and it is likely that he and Stickney (a carpenter by trade), personally constructed the home in the fall of 1912 or spring of 1913.

                <h3>The Modern Cottage</h3>
                <p>
                    The original house plans have not been located, but Advertisements posted during the 1920s describe the home as
                    a "Modern Five Room Cottage".
                    "Modern" was an important term here as "modern" construction techniques of wooden framing, plaster finishes, and concrete foundations had only recently been introduced to the city's working class housing stock in the 1900s and 1910s.
                </p>
                    Still, details found in the home today along with similar bungalow plans from the 1910s help form a picture of the original home.
                    The single-story house was framed around a mason chimney which would have been used for cooking and heating.
                    It featured a decorative dormer and an open front porch.
                </p>
                <img src="img/herald/1911-11-11_36.png" width="500">
                <p>A similar bungalow plan, advertised in the <i>Herald</i>.</p>
                <p>
                    The home's construction came at the tail end of the housing boom.
                    In 1913, British capital became more difficult to acquire, slowing construction.
                    By the end of the year building activity had fallen and the advent of WW1 the following year drew people and resources out of the region.
                    For several decades the back alley of the home effective marked the edge of development for the city's north west.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is unclear if the home was originally built to be sold off but Foster and Stickney remained the
                    owners
                    until 1925 while several families rented the home.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first family to occupy the home is that of Charles Randolph Grant, a blacksmith and recent
                    emmigrant
                    from New Brunswick.
                    Co-incidentally, Grant was from the same county as both Foster and Stickney and had emmigrated that year.
                    It is possible that the three knew of each other and that Foster, who had come to Calgary in 1905, encouraged the other two families to join him in the West.

                    During the War the family of Alfred Leary occopied the home.
                    Alfred worked as a driver and his wedding to Margaret Blythe is preserved in the Glenbow Archives.
                    One member of the household, a brother Clement, served and died on the Western Front of the War.

                    The home was unsuccesfully advertised for sale during 1923 and 1924, perhaps reflecting the depressed market which existed after the pre-war boom.
                    The home was finally sold in 1925 to Arthur Sheane, who had rented the home for the previous five years.

                <h3>Another Boom</h3>
                <p>
                    The energy crisis of the 1970s elevated oil prices throughout the decade, providing a massive economic injection to the city.
                    Housing prices climbed and the Warner family must have decided to cash out, selling the home for a price four times greater than their intial purchase.
                    The sale history of the home during 1977 reflects the pressure on housing in the city.
                    During the space of two months, three land titles were issued to the property: first to developer John Falconer, followed by an investment company, before finally being sold to the Richardson family.
